#Fibonacci

This rails app is a test of the [Fibonacci Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). It accepts an input and finds what nth Fibonacci sequence number is.

For example, if you would like to see what the third number of the Fibonacci sequence, you would add 0 + 1 to give you 1 then add the last number of the previous sequence (1) with the result of that last sequence (1), which gives you 2. Then finally 1 + 2 to give you 3.

To find the fourth, you would simply add 2 + 3 to get 5. And so on.

##Use of the Function

To use the fibonacci function, you simply add an input in the arguments. Example:

##Requirements

Input has to be a whole number higher than 0 (starting from 1).

```console
fib(5)
>> 8
```
